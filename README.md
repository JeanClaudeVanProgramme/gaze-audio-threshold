# gaze-audio-threshold
Experimental Gaze-contingent software for estimating auditory detection and discrimination thresholds

This is part of research funded by EU's Marie Curie Initiative LanPercept
https://www.ntnu.edu/lanpercept

*REQUIREMENTS* 
Matlab is required Earlier versions may or may not 
work - the current software was developed with Matlab 2016/2017
https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html

And the Psychophysics toolbox version 3
http://psychtoolbox.org/

Note this code was originally developed for TobiiSDK 3.0.83
Tobii has subsequently completed revised their SDK. We have included
the old SDK in the repository 'tobii-analytics-sdk-3.0.83.zip'

In the future we hope the code base will be updated to reflect the new SDK

Please consult ReadMe.txt for use instructions. 
StartConditioningExps.m is used to run the experiment, and along with
LoadContants.m, SetCalibParams.m they form the 3 main files to edit for various 
parameters, paths, and setting up conditions.
